High volume and often too-quick settlements that get you less than you deserve – the churn and burn model. You – your injuries, your family, those weeks you spent in the hospital, everything you’ve been through – become just one more anonymous case among hundreds of others</p>

                                    <p>Brian Bagley and his law firm helped me file for divorce. My divorce was fairly easy in the fact that my ex and I didn't fight over much or have many shared assets. This law firm allowed me to do as much of the work as possible to save money but also made sure my best interests were always the priority. They followed up with regularly, checked in when needed but did not schedule pointless meetings or phone calls to raise the overall cost. In the end my divorce went smoothly, it was completed in just over 90 days and I received everything I asked for including my property, my retirement, and shared debt responsibility. I would definitely use this firm again and I recommend them on a regular basis. It is a little expensive but comparative and when compared to what could be lost in divorce it was a bargain.</p>

                            <p>Tim Edstrom is a senior associate at The Bagley Law Firm, LLC.  While his current focus is in criminal defense and family law, he has extensive experience in a wide variety of legal fields that include workers' compensation, immigration, Social Security, civil litigation for personal injury, business disputes, civil rights violations, sexual harassment, and securities regulation.</p>
							<p>		
							When looking into Tim's legal background, one will find that Tim has litigated some of the most high-profile civil rights cases in Colorado history, including the contentious and highly-publicized Michael DeHerrera and Juan Vasquez police brutality lawsuits.
							</p>
							​
							<p>
							Alone or as lead counsel, he has conducted approximately 60 jury trials for cases that range from criminal defense of murder-in-the-first-degree to civil cases with millions of dollars on the line. However, Tim feels just at home when litigating child custody issues or misdemeanor matters before the local municipal magistrate.
							</p>
							​
							<p>
							A graduate of the University of Denver College of Law, and having graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a degree in political science, Tim has deep roots in Colorado.  For instance, he has lived in Longmont, Colorado for over a quarter-century, where he currently lives with his wife, Christina, and two small children.

During his legal studies, he served as a member – and executive – to the law school’s Public Interest Student Association.
							</p>
							 
							<p>
							Before joining the Bagley Law Firm, LLC, Scott’s passion for social justice took him to New York City where he attended Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in human rights and graduating with a 3.94 GPA. Long before this, however, Scott had been an advocate against domestic violence, having worked with organizations such as the Bringing Justice Home Project, an anti-domestic-violence project within Crossroads Safehouse in Fort Collins, Colorado.
							</p>
							 
							<p>
							Among his non-legal accomplishments, Scott presently serves on Littleton's city council as its Mayor Pro Tem. He has hiked the Colorado Trail, a stunningly beautiful 500-mile stretch of Colorado wilderness. In his spare time, he also enjoys birding, fly fishing, and gardening. Scott and his wife have a daughter and son.

                                <h3>Phil Clark, J.D.</h3>
                                <p>SENIOR ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY</p>
                                <p>CRIMINAL DEFENSE</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Phil Clark's talent for criminal defense is in his DNA, literally; litigating is a tradition in Phil Clark’s family, going back five generations, starting with Jonas J. Clark, who was appointed by Abraham Lincoln as the United States Attorney for District of Kansas City in 1861. Phil Clark is also a descendant of William Clark, the frontier explorer best recognized from his "partnership," Lewis and Clark.</p>
							<p>
							Living up to his namesake, Phil Clark attended and excelled in law school at the University of Denver and never once veered from his life's ambition -- to become a world-class trial attorney.
							</p>
							 
							<p>
							Unheard of in this century, before Phil was even licensed to practice law, he had successfully performed over 35 trials as a supervised student attorney. Then, when he passed the Colorado bar exam in 1990, he did so with a score so high that the second portion of the test was waived. 
							</p>
							 
							<p>
							Upon being admitted as a licensed attorney, Phil became a senior prosecutor and served in the district attorney's office for nearly two decade in the Metro-Denver area, where he prosecuted homicides, drug distribution, DUIs, domestic violence, and nearly every type of felony, misdemeanor, and traffic offense on the books. Phil became intimately familiar with the perspectives, procedures, and philosophies of the prosecution and law enforcement community.
							</p>
							 
							<p>
							Eventually, Phil was appointed second-in-command of the Weld County District Attorney’s Office. He was then elected as a member of the Colorado District Attorney’s Council State Governing Board where he served with each elected District Attorney in Colorado, members of the Governor’s Office, members of the Attorney General’s Office, members of the United States Attorney’s Office, and other high-ranking government officials.
							</p>
							​
							<p>
							Phil has been involved in numerous well-publicized cases and is highly respected in the legal community. With a "Never say die!" reputation, Phil is widely recognized as a legal expert and has taught at both the high school and college level. However, Mr. Clark is most proud of the recognition and appreciation he has received, in private, from his clients for his devotion to -- and success with -- championing their cases.

                                <p>FAMILY LAW</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Growing up in rural Oklahoma, Jessica attended and graduated from The University of Oklahoma in 2015 with her Bachelor of Business Administration. Always ambitious, she graduated with a double major in Supply Chain Management and Marketing. Thereafter, Jessica was conferred a Juris Doctor in 2018 from Roger Williams University, graduating Cum Laude, recognized from among the top legal scholars in her graduating law-school class.</p>
							<p>
							After law school, Jessica was selected to clerk for the Honorable Seven Jourd of the 8th Judicial District in Larimer County. Completing her clerkship, Jessica moved on to focus her legal career on the area of family law. She now enjoys working in all aspects of family law, including divorce, child custody matters, contempt proceedings, child and spousal support enforcement, and post-decree modifications.
							</p>
							​
							<p>
							Jessica is uniquely qualified to represent both husbands and wives – fathers and mothers – as she has broad experience representing both “sides” of family law issues.
